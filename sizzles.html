        Sizzles is a mobile app that can be used for ordering food and groceries online. 
        It can be used to pre order food which will save time for working professionals and people who are busy and are 
        unable to order food at specified time.

        <h1 class="section-heading">Problem</h1><br/>
        <p class="section-paragraph">
            Often due to work we are unable to order food at the right time. Also since everyone orders at the same time the orders 
            may take more time than usual to deliver. There are no food delivery apps where the user can schedule the delivery. 
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section_text">
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Normally when we order food we expect it to reach us early and quick. What if by the time we order food we are already late
        and the delivery is also expected to delay it will be pretty frustrating. This is a common issue most working professional 
        face. Also in major cities during rush hour delivery takes lot of time also sometimes few restaurants will be unavailable 
        due to too many orders.
        <br/><br/>
        So to avoid this problem in Sizzles the user can order anytime and schedule a time for delivery. So that his order will be 
        delivered on time.

        I have designed low fidelity wireframes to get better idea of how the finished design look and also to make any changes
        that are to be made to improve the design of the application. After creating wireframes I made iterations on the design
        and based on the feedback from the users I have changed and updated the desing in my final prototype.

        The homepage shows all restaurants that are near to the user. Each restaurant card displays restaurant name, ratings, estimated
        time for delivery. Based on this information user can choose the right restaurant. The user can also sort the restaurants using
        tags.<br/><br/><br/>

          The Restaurant page has information regarding the restaurant along with menu. Menu is seperated into categories for easy
          accessibility. Traditional Menu cards have food segregated into categories. So to maintain the familiarity the menu is displayed 
          as categories. User can select a category to explore the food. There is also sorting tags to improve the accessibility.

        There is a schedule delivery option in the billing page so user can choose the delivery time. They can order anytime of
        the day and schedule the time of delivery. After selecting address and payment method they can review order before the payment.

          The Design solved the user's problem. Using the current system they can schedule the order and they will receive the food in time.
          Restaurants also liked this idea because they have a count of how many orders should be prepared which will help in reducing the 
          chances of shortage or excess cooking of food.
