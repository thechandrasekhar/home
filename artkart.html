        ARTKART is an online Art Auction mobile application through which artists can sell their art. Organising an Art Auction
        is not easy. Also artists and potential buyers have no reliable platform to purchase and sell art. Artkart acts as a bridge
        and between artists and potential buyers.

        <h1 class="section-heading">Problem</h1><br/>
        <p class="section-paragraph">
          Artists who cannot afford to organize art exhibitions have no reliable platform which can be used to sell their art. 
        </p>

      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Artists who are early in their career cannot afford to organise art auctions. Also, buyers have to wait
        for the art auctions and exhibitons to purchase art as a result both artists and buyers do not have 
        a platform to conduct the trade.<br/><br/>
        Our goal is to design a mobile application that can be used to purchase and sell art online by conducting
        custom auctions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

        I have designed low fidelity wireframes to get better idea of how the finished design look and also to make any changes
        that are to be made to improve the design of the application. After creating wireframes I made iterations on the design
        and based on the feedback from the users I have changed and updated the desing in my final prototype.

        I have designed the homepage where the user can see various types of art that is being uploaded on to the app for bidding.
        These recommendations are based on his interest and search history for a particular type of art.<br/><br/>
        I have designed the card layout to display all the vital information regarding the art. It includes details like artist name
        art dimensions, type of art, time remaining for the bidding etc. There is also a save button which sends a remainder 
        notification incase the buyer forgets to bid.

        The Art uploading process is very important and it has been divided into three parts first art uploading, Art details,
        Auction date and time. Finally user gets a preview and then the user can upload their artwork.

          There is an explore page where user can search for new art. Different categories of art is sorted for easy access to the user.
          Finally there is a profile page where the user can view his uploaded art and also can manage their account.
